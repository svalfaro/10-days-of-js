Complete the function in the editor. It has two parameters: a and b. It must return an object modeling a rectangle that has the following properties:

    -> length: This value is equal to a.
    -> width: This value is equal to b.
    -> perimeter: This value is equal to 2(a+b) 
    -> area: This value is equal to a*b 
*/

function Rectangle(a, b) {
  this.length = a;
  this.width = b;
  this.perimeter = 2 * (a + b);
  this.area = a * b;
}
