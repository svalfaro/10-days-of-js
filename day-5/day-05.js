We provide the implementation for a Rectangle class in the editor. Perform the following tasks:

    -> Add an area method to Rectangle's prototype.
    -> Create a Square class that satisfies the following:
    -> It is a subclass of Rectangle.
    -> It contains a constructor and no other methods.
    -> It can use the Rectangle class' area method to print the area of a Square object.
*/

class Rectangle {
  constructor(w, h) {
    this.w = w;
    this.h = h;
  }
}

Rectangle.prototype.area = function () {
  return this.w * this.h;
};

class Square extends Rectangle {
  constructor(s) {
    super(s);
    this.h = s;
    this.w = s;
  }
}
